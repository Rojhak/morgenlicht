## 2026-05-12 - Explicit Label for Select Dropdowns
**Learning:** In the search interface, using a plain `<span>` next to a `<select>` dropdown means screen readers may not announce the field's purpose when focused, and it reduces the clickable target area.
**Action:** Always pair `<select>` dropdowns explicitly with a `<label>` using matching `id` and `htmlFor` attributes.
