# Instructions

- Use semantic HTML tags (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`) for accessibility.
- Apply Tailwind responsive prefixes (sm, md, lg) by default for mobile-first design.
- Include `loading.tsx` for every async route to improve UX.
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards for elderly users (larger fonts, high contrast, clear navigation).
- Use German language for content as per SGB XI requirements.
