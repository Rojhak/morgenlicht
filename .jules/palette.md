## 2025-02-07 - Focus Management with Sticky Headers
**Learning:** Programmatic focus (e.g., `element.focus()`) scrolls the element to the top of the viewport, often hiding it behind sticky headers.
**Action:** Always add `scroll-margin-top` (e.g., `scroll-mt-32`) to focusable targets (headings, containers) to ensure visibility.
